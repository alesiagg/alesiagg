- 👋 Hi, I’m @alesiagg
- 👀 I’m currently interested in Rstudio programming,proteomics and transcriptomics, as it is also involved with my current occupation.
- 🌱 I am also currently studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Genoa, but I already have a bachelor's in Electronics & Digital Communications Engineering. However I am more interested in working in the biomedical field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects in bioinformatics or biomedical imaging. I am very efficient in MatLab and I'm currently learning more about Rstudio, but I have experience with reconstructing images in C++ as well.
